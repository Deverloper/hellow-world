Hello!

About me:

          I made it! Currently in a process of learning Web Development and Github, I like working on complex projects with programmers where I can contribute something while learning. I have a solid understanding of computer softwares such as: MS-Dos, etc... which I hope that I can put into use for future projects. 
          
          I like workingout, staying fit & healthy. I lik dogs and probably the best excuse I can come up with to stay outdoor!
          Em... That's all.
